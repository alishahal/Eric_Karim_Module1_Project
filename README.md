Our Project is about an Indian Restaurant offering a lots of mouth watering Indian street food dishes. Like Saag Panner,Butter Chicken Curry, etc. 

   The program starts with the welcome and asking name of the customer. After the customer enters his name, the display shows the Welcome screen with the name of the customer, and the list of the items available as a menu.

	 --- Order an entree
	 --- Could you tell me about a menu item?
	 --- View my bill so far
	 --- I would like to see your dessert options



  When customer(user) select "Order an entree"   it shows sub menu : 

		    --- Saag Paneer
				--- Butter Chicken Curry
				--- Sayel Lamb Curry
    After he selects the item from the sub menu it adds the item to his bill(order).


  If the customer selects the 2nd option: Could you tell me about a menu item?
		       It list all the available menu items :

				--- Saag Paneer
				--- Butter Chicken Curry
				--- Sayel Lamb Curry
		
  If the customer selects the 3rd option: View my bill so far.
		       It lists his or her total bill, and asks for wether he/she would like to pay now 
					 or he/she wants to order something else.
